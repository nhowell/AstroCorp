# Exo

A React UI for the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io).

The goal of this project is to build a user interface for the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io) while also exploring some technologies that I've wanted to try out, such as `react-query` and `react-three-fiber`.

It is a work-in-progress.
