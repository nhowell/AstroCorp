# Exo

A React UI for [SpaceTraders v1](https://spacetraders.io).

The goal of this project was to build a user interface for the [SpaceTraders v1 API](https://api.spacetraders.io/v1) while also exploring some technologies that I've wanted to try out, such as `react-query` and `react-three-fiber`.

This project is in maintenance-mode, so I'll mostly only be updating dependencies from this point forward. I've started working on building Exo 2 using the [SpaceTraders v2 API](https://api.spacetraders.io/v2).
