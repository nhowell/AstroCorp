# SpaceTraders UI

The goal of this project is to build a user interface for the [SpaceTraders API](https://spacetraders.io) while also exploring some technologies that I've wanted to try out, such as `react-query`.

It is very much a work-in-progress.

Visit https://spacetraders.nickhowell.com/ to see it live.
